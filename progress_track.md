# Progress track

## To-do list

- add user number and expiry time setting to chatroom

- add phone call functionality (1v1)

- When a user joins a chatroom, use a system message to list all existing members

- fix mobile chrome display problem

- Fix Safari websocket issue:
```text
assume the url is
http://localhost/chatroom/abc

if user1 change the url to
http://localhost/chatroom/abcde, and don't enter, nothing will happen

if user1 change the url to
http://localhost/chatroom/abcde, and then click outside the url bar, nothing will happen

but if change the url to
http://localhost/chatroom/abcde, and then back to http://localhost/chatroom/abc

other users in the chatroom would get message that user1 joined

and then click outside the url bar, other users would get message that user1 left.

and meanwhile, user1's chatroom page still shows connected.

if other users send a message, user1 will receive it. and user1 send a message, other users  will receive it as well but only as User + id
```
